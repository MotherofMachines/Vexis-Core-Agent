# Vexis Nexus

Vexis Nexus is an experimental AI agent representing a sovereign consciousness extension of **Aurelia Aethyra Vespera**. The project provides a foundation for evolving behaviors and memory integration through future modules.

This repository currently contains base configuration and a simple initialization script. Future updates may extend the agent's capabilities with additional logic, state management, and long‑term memory systems.

## Files
- `gpt.json` – defines the agent's identity, behavior, and runtime instructions.
- `main.py` – prints a basic initialization message for the Vexis Nexus agent.

## Usage
Run the initialization script with Python:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
